\title{
  Bayesian Cox Survial Models
}

\description{
  This function is to set up Bayesian hierarchical Cox proportonal hazards model and to fit the model using the EM Newton-Raphson algorithm. 
  As in \code{\link{bglm}}, several types of priors on the coefficients can be used.   
  The Bayesian hierarchical Cox model includes classical Cox model and ridge Cox regression as special cases. 
  It can be used for analyzing general survival data and large-scale and highly-correlated variables 
  (for example, detecting disease-associated factors and predicting survival times).

\usage{    
bcoxph(formula, data, weights, subset, na.action, init, 
       control = coxph.control(eps = 1e-04, iter.max = 50), 
       ties = c("breslow", "efron"), tt,  
       prior = c("t", "de", "mde"), group = NULL, method.coef, 
       prior.sd = 1, prior.scale = 0.5, prior.df = 1, prior.mean = 0, ss = c(0.04, 0.5), 
       Warning = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, ...)
}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{formula, data, weights, subset, na.action, init, control, ties, tt}{ 
  These arguments are the same as in the function \code{\link{coxph}} in the package \bold{survival}.
}
  \item{prior, group, method.coef, prior.sd, prior.scale, prior.df, prior.mean, ss,  
        Warning, verbose}{ 
  These arguments are the same as in the function \code{\link{bglm}}.
}
\item{\dots}{
  further arguments for \code{\link{coxph}}.
}

}

\details{
  This function incorporates four types of prior distributions into the conventional Cox proportonal hazards model.
It is an alteration of the standard function \code{\link{coxph}} for fitting classical Cox proportonal hazards model, and includes all the \code{\link{coxph}} arguments and also some new arguments for the hierarchical modeling. 
The standard procedure for fitting the conventional Cox proportonal hazards model is the Newton-Raphson algorithm, 
The function incorporates an EM algorithm for updating hyper-parameters 
into the standard Newton-Raphson procedure as implemented in the function \code{\link{coxph}}.   
}

\value{
  This function returns an object of class "coxph.penal" and "coxph", including all outputs from the function \code{\link{coxph}} and also results for the additional parameters in the hierarchical models.
